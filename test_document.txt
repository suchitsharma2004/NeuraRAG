RAG Assistant Test Document

This is a test document for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) assistant application.

Overview:
The RAG Assistant is a Django-based application that allows users to upload documents and ask questions about their content using artificial intelligence.

Key Features:
1. Document Upload: Users can upload PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
2. Text Processing: The system extracts text from documents and splits it into chunks
3. Vector Search: Documents are converted to embeddings for semantic search
4. AI Responses: Uses Google Gemini to generate natural language responses
5. Source Citations: Responses include references to the original documents

Technical Architecture:
- Backend: Django with Django REST Framework
- AI Model: Google Gemini API for language generation
- Embeddings: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Vector Database: FAISS for similarity search
- Task Queue: Celery with Redis for background processing

How it Works:
1. User uploads a document through the web interface
2. System extracts text and splits it into chunks
3. Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding
4. Embeddings are stored in FAISS vector database
5. When user asks a question, the system:
   - Converts the question to an embedding
   - Searches for similar chunks in the vector database
   - Sends relevant chunks to Gemini for response generation
   - Returns AI-generated answer with source citations

Use Cases:
- Research document analysis
- Legal document review
- Technical documentation queries
- Academic paper exploration
- Business document insights

- What is this document about?
- What are the key features mentioned?
- How does the RAG system work?
